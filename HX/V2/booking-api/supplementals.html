<h2 id="supplemental-packages">Supplemental packages</h2>
<p>Supplemental packages offer passengers a convenient way to get to and from their travel destinations.
An arrival package helps with getting to the start location and a departure package helps with getting back home from the end location.</p>
<h3 id="searching-for-supplemental-packages">Searching for supplemental packages</h3>
<p>You can search for available supplemental packages through <a href="endpoints/search-supplemental-packages.html">the Search Supplemental Packages endpoint</a>, where <code>packageType</code> is either <code>arrival</code> or <code>departure</code>.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-supplemental-package-to-a-quote">Adding a supplemental package to a quote</h3>
<p>To add a supplemental package to a quote, you need to supply the passenger ids for the passengers that will use the supplemental package through <a href="endpoints/add-supplemental-package.html">the Add Supplemental Package endpoint</a>.</p>
<p>Some supplemental packages can be customized through selectable routes. For an additional cost, it is possible to change the start location of an arrival package or the end location of a departure package.
When this is supported by a supplemental package, you will get the selectable route details and prices as part of the search results.
If there are no supplemental package details, then selectable routes are not supported by the package.</p>
