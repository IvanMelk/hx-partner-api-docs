<h2 id="minimal-booking-flow">Minimal booking flow</h2>
<p>For a minimal, working booking flow, you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search for a package to get an initial quote id</li>
<li>Supply the required details to create the quote <!-- TODO - Feels weird to call this "creating" a quote --></li>
<li>Commit the quote to convert it into a new booking</li>
</ol>
<p>If an uncommitted quote is no longer of interest, then it can be manually deleted.</p>
<h3 id="searching-for-a-package">Searching for a package</h3>
<p>To start the booking flow, you need to perform a search for the desired package through <a href="endpoints/search-package.html">the Search Package endpoint</a> using a package code obtained from the flat files.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-quote">Creating a quote</h3>
<p>To create a quote based on the package search results, you need to supply the departure and cabin selection along with passengers details through <a href="endpoints/create-quote.html">the Create Quote endpoint</a>.</p>
<h3 id="fetching-a-valid-quote">Fetching a valid quote</h3>
<p>You can fetch currently valid quotes through <a href="endpoints/get-quote.html">the Get Quote endpoint</a> to check their contents.</p>
<h3 id="deleting-a-quote">Deleting a quote</h3>
<p>You can delete valid, uncommitted quotes through <a href="endpoints/delete-quote.html">the Delete Quote endpoint</a>.</p>
<h3 id="commiting-a-quote">Commiting a quote</h3>
<p>To convert a quote into a new booking, you need to commit the quote by supplying the payment type for the booking through <a href="endpoints/commit-quote.html">the Commit Quote endpoint</a>.</p>
<h3 id="fetching-a-booking">Fetching a booking</h3>
<p>You can fetch bookings through <a href="endpoints/get-booking.html">the Get Booking endpoint</a>. At the moment, there is a limited amount of booking info that is available through the API.</p>
